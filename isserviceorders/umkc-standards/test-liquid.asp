  <h1>Academic Unit Pathway help</h1>
	<h3><a href="#">Accessing Pathway using your SSO, click here</a></h3>
	  <p>Your SSO is the part of your UMKC email before the @ sign. Please keep in mind that you must login with your official SSO username (similar to &quot;abc123&quot;) and not an alias.</p>
	  <p>You will use your SSO and password for accessing Pathway, just as you use it to access your UMKC email, Blackboard or to log on to computers in the campus computer labs. </p>
	<h3><a href="#">Setting up your SSO, click here</a></h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Your SSO is e-mailed or mailed to you when you apply for admission.</li>
	    <li> New students are automatically assigned a Single Sign On (SSO) which is also known as a User ID.</li>
	    <li> If you know your SSO, but do not know or forgot your password here are <a href="/forms/passwordsetup.pdf" target="_blank">Instructions on setting-up a new password</a></li>
	    <li> If you were given your SSO and a Bootstrap password here are <a href="/forms/PathwayBootstrapLogin.pdf" target="_blank">Instructions on how to set-up a real password</a></li>
	    <li> <a href="http://www.umkc.edu/is/userpassword.asp" target="_blank">Change, reset or recover your password</a> </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>If you are still having trouble setting up your SSO contact the Call Center at 816-235-2000 or <a href="mailto:callcenter@umkc.edu">callcenter@umkc.edu </a></p>
	<h3><a href="#">E-Consent, click here</a></h3>
		<p>When you first log-on to Pathway, you must provide your consent to do business with UMKC online. If you choose not to provide your consent, you will have to do all business with UMKC in person at the Administrative Center during regular business hours.</p>
		<p> Once you have decided whether or not to grant consent, you will be re-directed to the sign-on page and you must log-on again to access your information.
		  If you grant your consent and later wish to withdraw it, complete the <a href="forms/eConsentWD.pdf" target="_blank">E-consent Withdrawal Form</a> and submit it to the Registration and Records Office </p>
